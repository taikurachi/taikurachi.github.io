        The Dollie Clones are a collection of two telerobotic dolls based on
        Lynn Hershman Leeson herself and her alter ego, Roberta Breitmore.
        CybeRoberta is a miniature replica of Roberta Breitmore and Tillie the
        Telerobotic Doll, a doll version of Leeson, resembles her evil twin.

        These toys catered toward children are designed like cyborgs and have
        cameras as their eyes. When these twins are exhibited in galleries,
        people can see the world through their perspective using a live video
        feed or on their designated website where updated images are posted
        every thirty seconds. Additionally, online viewers can control the
        direction of the dolls' gaze by clicking on the images of their eyes,
        allowing them to explore their surroundings.
      </div>
      <div class="item three">
        The Dollie Clones address various topics that Hershman Leeson has been
        interested in exploring throughout her career, including surveillance,
        the malleability of identity, clones and cyborgs, and the representation
        of gender and the self.
