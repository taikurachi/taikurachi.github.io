    Aureia Harvey is a digital artist/sculptor who coded websites as art and
    listed them on the internet. Her early childhood consisted of messing around
    with code in magazines and debugging in the included programs. <br />
    <br />
    <br />

    <br /><br />
    The fact that she saw the opportunity to learn html when the internet just
    came out is very impressive. With her proactiveness, she was able to find
    many jobs and opportunities to pursue her passion. She also did this during
    a time period when girls working with computers were something out of the
    ordinary. <br /><br />

    <br /><br />She says that she wishes for future artists to work purely
    digitally and make a living in the same way as other artists. I admire her
    compassion and the way she wants to inspire future generations.
